Rollback
====================================================================================
Get all matching documents, sorted by date desc, set rolledback = true, put into rollback map {key = location}
Make empty rollback set
Make empty change map {key = location, value = toBlock}
For every location
    a) Check for any newer changes on the location. If found, remove all blocks with location from rollback set
    b) Chain down from current.blockFrom -> next.blockTo of current set of blocks
    c) If the chain terminates, get blocks with rolledback = true at same location to continue chain, if any found, append to current set of blocks, return to (b), otherwise do (d)
    d) End loop, add chain to rollback set and end to change map
For the entire rollback set, delete from database
For entire change map, perform changes
